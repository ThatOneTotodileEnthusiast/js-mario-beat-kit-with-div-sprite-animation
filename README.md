# js-mario-beat-kit-with-div-sprite-animation

Was inspired by this fantastic artcile that showed an alternative to animating sprites from the usual HTML Canvas.

The project involves use of flexbox, <audio> tags and the data-key attributes to map specific keys to perform specific audio cues.

A sprite of mario also appears on the top, who can be seen performing a walking or jumping animation by performing the 2 actions below:-

1. Holding the 'Left/Right' arrow key.
2. Holding the 'Up' arrow key.

This was just one of the cooler concepts I came across, and I definitely plan to make improvements on this to the point of creating a proof of concept
mario level using DOM sprites completely!

Appreciate any feedback or ideas the community might have, and definitely suggest you have a read of the article shared above.
